# connect_four

## in progress:
training project for lasp and lockheed. using pyqt5 to build a connect four gui and also creating an ai bot to play against users. the ai will use the minimax algorithm to search the game tree for optimal play. 

## to run:
simply clone or download and run ./main.py to open the app. i scaled it to the size of the user screen, so ideally it should look good on any size screen.
